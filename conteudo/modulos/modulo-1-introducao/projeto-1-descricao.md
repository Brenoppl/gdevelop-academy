# Simple Clicker Game Project

## Objectives
- Create a basic clicker game to understand game development fundamentals.
- Implement user interactions and reward mechanisms.

## Game Mechanics
- **Clicking:** The core mechanic is clicking on an object (e.g., a cookie) to earn points.
- **Upgrades:** Players can purchase upgrades using points earned from clicking to increase the points per click.
- **Resource Management:** Players manage their resources to maximize score.

## Interface Requirements
- **Main Screen:** A large clickable object, a score counter, and an upgrade button.
- **Menu:** A simple menu for settings and help.

## Step by Step Phases
1. **Design the Game:** Create sketches of the user interface and define game flow.
2. **Set Up the Environment:** Choose a game engine (e.g., GDevelop) and set up your project.
3. **Implement Core Mechanics:**  Create clickable objects and implement scoring.
4. **Add Upgrades:** Implement the upgrade mechanic allowing purchase of enhancements.
5. **Test the Game:** Conduct testing to ensure mechanics work as intended.
6. **Launch the Game:** Publish your game for others to play.

## Possible Extensions
- **Additional Levels:** Introduce new environments or themes.
- **Leaderboards:** Add a competitive aspect by showing top scores.
- **Achievements:** Implement achievements for players to unlock.

## Completion Checkpoints
- Game prototype is playable and demonstrates core mechanics.
- Upgrades functionality works and provides meaningful choices.
- User testing completed with feedback gathered for improvements.

## Resources Needed
- **Game Engine:** GDevelop or any preferred engine.
- **Graphics:** Basic graphics design tools (or free asset websites).
- **Sound Effects:** Simple sounds for clicks and upgrades (can be sourced from free libraries).

## Estimated Time
